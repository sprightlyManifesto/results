#Configuration

The results system uses csv (comma seperated value) file for the handicaps and Quick Entry code (QEcode) file to provide details of the racers and the handicaps of their boats.

##QE file
some examples of QE are given below:

RFD,Robert Finch,,DART 18,6223,1033,M,G
RH3,Richard Hargreaves,,RS 300,373,982,S,G

or in tabulated form:

| QE code | Helm | Crew| Class| Sail No| personal handicap| Age group| Fleet|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|RFD |Robert Finch ||DART 18| 6223|1033|M|G|
|RH3 |Richard Hargreaves ||RS 300|373|982|S|G|
 
|Feild|Description|
|--|--|
|QE   |the unique identifyer feild this is the code the race officer enters into the raceGUI interface to specfiy the racer idealy it should be [helm FirstInital][helmLastInitial][class id][crewfirstInital][crewlastInitial]|
|helm|name of helm (STRING)|
|Crew|name of crew (STRING)|
|Class|Class of dinghy (STRING) nb: this must match one in the handicaps file|
|Sail no| Optional field (STRING)|
|Personal handicap|(int) 0 -1500 for new sailors input 0,  personal handcaps are generated by the audit process|
|Age group|(char) vaild chars J,S,M,G corisponding to junior (under 18) senior (up to 45) masters (up to 60) grand masters (>60) |
|Fleet|(char), legacy field for gold and silver fleets no longer used but still required valid values are S,G|

##handicap file
some example handcaps are given bellow,  these adopt the same form as the rya py list to allow for simple cut and past from the excel document when it is published each year.
https://www.rya.org.uk/racing/technical/handicap-systems/portsmouth-yardstick

HERON,1345,D,U,1,0
HOBIE 16,819,C,S,2,0

or in tablulated form:

|Class|PY|Rig|Spiniker|no crew|chage from previous list|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|HERON|1345|D|U|1|0|
|HOBIE 16|819|C|S|2|0|

only the class and PY are requred by the system but other feilds must be present even if not poulated ie:
HOBIE 16,819,,,,

##config.json
config.json specfies the current handicap nad QEfile to use.

["2020.csv","2022_QE_NOV.txt"]

it is done in this way as during the season the QE file is regenrated by the audit.py script at the end of each serise to update the personal handicaps and this allows the old handicap files to be kept and used by the results.py script to generate all the serise outpus.

#Use
to create a new race from terminal or desktop shortcut run:   /installPath/raceGUI.py
this will launch the race entry GUI.
